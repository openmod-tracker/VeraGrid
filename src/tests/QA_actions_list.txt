?- Create a reactance (series)
*- Create a load / generator and introduce a profile
- Scale load / generation per area
- Run power flow
- Contingencies
- Change inter-area exchange
- Create HVDC line and set a power dispatch profile

- Import PSSe
- Create new diagram from a selection of an existing one
- Create an empty diagram and populate it with DB objects
- Wheels. To be confirmed
- Check copy paste of profiles



Videos
-----------
Video 1. Create a substation

   - 1 Drag the bus
     - Define name
     - Define voltage
   - 2 Go to Substation/Substations in DB
     - (+) Button - Create a new one
     - Fill the fields
   - 3 Go to Substation/Voltage level in DB (Parque in Spanish)
     - (+) Button - Create a new one
     - Fill the fields


Video 2. Create a line and its contingencies

    - 1 Create a line that exists in the catalog:
        - Check voltage of both buses
        - Check/load catalog
        - Draw line
        - Define name (legible)
        - Mention if you want to add PSSE code (it does not affect)
        - Set length
        - Set template
        - Add to contingencies
        - Add to investments

    - 2 Create a line that does not exist in the catalog:
        - Check voltage of both buses
        - Draw line
        - Define name (legible)
        - Mention if you want to add PSSE code (it does not affect)
        - Define the parameters
        - Create the profiles
        - Add to contingencies
        - Add to investments

     - 3 Add a double contingency

Video 3: Create In-and-out in a line

    - 1 Select the line where I want to create the In-and-out in a line
    - 2 Right bottom - SPlit line with in/out
        - Define % of the length where I want to split the line
        - Define the kilometers of the in and out lines

    Notes: The new power lines parameters will be the same as the original power line

Video 4: Add something (injection) to a bus (load or a generator..)

    - 1 Select the bus I want to install the load or generator
    - 2 Right button - Load / Generator....
    - 3 Set the value of the P or Q
    - 4 Go to the DB and select the load/generator... Click the "Assign the selected property to the matching profile". Accept the message
    - 5 If I want to set a predefined profile, check add profiles to an object property

Video 5: Transform a line into other series element (reactance, transformer, ...)

    - 1 Select the line I want to install the load or generator
    - 2 Right button - Reactance / Transformer....
    - 3 Set the value parameters X
    - 4 Go to the DB and select the reactance/transformer..... Click the "Assign the selected property to the matching profile". Accept the message
    - 5 If I want to set a predefined profile, check add profiles to an object property

Video 6: Add a profile to an object property
    - Using copy paste:
        - 1. Database / Time series
        - 2. Select where I want to paste it, and press paste button
    - Importing profiles:
        - 1. Database / Time series / Import profiles
        - 2 Import profile. Select sheet. ok . The prfile should have the samde length as the original GridCal time series
        - 3 Find the element I want to assign the profile and select it. Double click on the Profile box
        - 4 Important! Unmark both, set unasigned to zero, and normalize.
        - 5 Accept

Video 7: Scale load / generation per area
    - 1 Menu - Model - Scale
    - 2 Select the Zone/ Region/Munipality I want to scale up/down
    - 3 Select the factor
    - 4 Choose if I want to do it in the snapshot (default), or if I want to extend it to the profiles (mark the check)
    - 5 Do it



Others:
- Execute a contingencies study (with clustering)
- Visualize dense areas
- Filters
