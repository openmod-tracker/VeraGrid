The assets manager: from objects to matrices
============================================

One of the key things that make GridCal special is that the devices
of the electrical grids are handled by an object-oriented asset manager.
This means that the real-life objects like generators are objects in GridCal
too, instead of a row in a database or table. This makes the handling of the
information very flexible and maintainable. If I had to pinpoint the biggest
advantage of GridCal it would be this one.

Most (if not all) other open source grid calculation tools use tables as input;
The advantage of a table based management of the information is that it is
more or less easy to compose the calculation matrices from those tables.
The disadvantage is that maintaining and extending a table-based model is
hard. GridCal started out being table-based too, but soon this approach
was disregarded because of the limitations this design imposes.

This object oriented approach and the structure used in GridCal seems to make
it harder for most electrical engineers when getting started developing with GridCal.
It is hard, because the structure might seem over-engineered, however it is 
this structure what enables seamless multi-island calculations and the
easy handling of time series, so it is key to explain "why" and "how".
In this section I'll explain the information "compilation" procedure used in 
GridCal, hoping that this makes GridCal more approachable for future 
contributors.

Structure
---------

The structure used to compile the information might seem convoluted and 
unnecessary. Experience has proven that this structure is very fast and it 
scales well (it is future-proof). 
Bear in mind that GridCal is not only a calculation library, but
it tries to make it as simple as possible for the user to input data, hence 
there is a careful equilibrium between usability and performance.

    :alt: Compilation process

    Objects compilation process

The simulations are handled by a driver. The driver accepts a MultiCircuit object as input.
The driver has a `run` method that compiles the `MultiCircuit` into a `NumericalCircuit` and then
the different topological partitions (islands) `CalculationInputs` are derived. Then the `run` method
passes each island to the numerical simulation, gathering the numerical results for the island and
merging the results into a general results object for all the islands. This is a powerful way to deal with topological changes.

MultiCircuit
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The multi-circuit, or asset manager is the main object in GridCal. 
It represents a group of objects conforming an electrical grid

NumericalCircuit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The numerical circuit contains the information of the objects in 1-dimensional 
arrays (vectors) ready to compute the topology of the grid and the calculation 
matrices and vectors. It also contains the connectivity matrices between 
objects.

This module is the one doing all the heavy lifting; For the computations ahead 
we will need to have a number of admittance-based matrices. 
We will compose matrices and vectors for the complete circuit, and
then split those per circuit island (CalculationInputs objects).
Remember that the calculation matrices are only valid for island circuits, 
this is because multi-island circuits present singular admittance matrices that 
lead to no numerical solution by their own.

    :alt: Element bus aggregations

    Element bus aggregations

The logic is to have a vector of magnitudes of an object type (i.e. all the 
active power power for all the generators) and a connectivity matrix that 
relates the generators with the buses of the grid. Multiplying the connectivity 
matrix by the element magnitudes vector we obtain the buses magnitudes vector 
that we need for calculation.

    # form the connectivity matrices with the states applied
    states_dia = diags(self.branch_states)
    Cf = states_dia * self.C_branch_bus_f
    Ct = states_dia * self.C_branch_bus_t

    # use the specified of the temperature-corrected resistance

Adjacency matrix
""""""""""""""""

The computation of the circuit adjacency matrix from matrices that we need anyway
for the admittance matrix computation is a very efficient way of dealing with the
topological computation. First we establish the total branch-bus connectivity matrix:

.. math::
    [C_{branch-bus}] = [C_f] + [C_t]

Then we compute the bus-bus connectivity matrix, which is the graph adjacency matrix:

.. math::
        [A] = [C_{branch-bus}]^\top \times [C_{branch-bus}]

Islands detection
"""""""""""""""""

The admittance matrix of a circuit with more than one island is singular.
Therefore, the circuit has to be split in sub-circuits in order to be solved.
The suggested algorithm to find the islands of a circuit is the Depth First Search
algorithm (DFS).

Previously it was already determined that the circuit complete graph is given by
the Bus-Bus connectivity matrix :math:`[C_{bus, bus}]`. This matrix is also known as the
node adjacency matrix. For algorithmic purposes we will call it the adjacency matrix :math:`A`.
As a side note, the matrix :math:`A` is a sparse matrix.

For algorithmic purposes,  :math:`A` is chosen to be a CSC sparse matrix.
This is important because the following algorithm uses the CSC sparse structure to
find the adjacent elements of a node.

The following function implements the non-recursive (hence faster) version of the DFS
algorithm, which traverses the bus-bus connectivity matrix (also known as the adjacent
graph matrix)

.. code::

This object contains the calculation arrays already split by island. Hence this
object contains information such as the island admittance matrix, the power 
injections and any other numerical array that the solvers may need.
