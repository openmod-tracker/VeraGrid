Installation
============

GridCal is designed to work with Python 3.6 and onwards, hence retro-compatibility is
not guaranteed.

Standalone setup
----------------

You can install GridCal as a separated standalone program without having to bother
about setting up python.

Remember to update the program to the latest version once installed. You'll find an
update script in the installation folder.

Python Package Installation
---------------------------

**GridCal** is multiplatform and it will work in Linux, Windows and OSX.

The recommended way to install **GridCal** if you have a python distribution already
is to open a console and type:

- **Windows**: :code:`pip install GridCal`
- **OSX / Linux**: :code:`pip3 install GridCal`

*You must have Python 3.6 or higher installed to work with the GUI.*

Check out the video on how to install `Python and GridCal on Windows 10 <https://youtu.be/yGxMq2JB1Zo>`_.

**Manual package installation**

Sometimes :code:`pip` does not download the lattest version for some reason. In those
cases, follow `this link <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GridCal>`_ and download the
latest **GridCal** file: `GridCal-x.xx.tar.gz`.

From a console install the file manually:

- **Windows**: :code:`pip install GridCal-x.xx.tar.gz`
- **OSX / Linux**: :code:`pip3 install GridCal-x.xx.tar.gz`

**Installation from GitHub**

To install the development version of **GridCal** that lives under **src**, open a
console and type:

.. code::

    python3 -m pip install -e 'git+git://github.com/SanPen/GridCal.git#egg=GridCal&subdirectory=src'

Installing **GridCal** from GitHub, **pip** can still freeze the version using a commit
hash:

.. code::

    python -m pip install -e 'git+git://github.com/SanPen/GridCal.git@5c4dcb96998ae882412b5fee977cf0cff7a40d3c#egg=GridCal&subdirectory=UnderDevelopment'

Here :code:`5c4dcb96998ae882412b5fee977cf0cff7a40d3c` is the **git** version.

PySide2 vs. PyQt5
------------------

Now GridCal has been completely ported to PySide2.
The reason for this is because PySide2 has been endorsed by Qt as the main python
wrapper for the Qt Library and therefore it is expected to have the best support.

However there are plenty of other libraries that depend of PyQt5 which is an alternative wrapper for the Qt
framework (and used to be the best one though)

After some test, I can tell you that if GridCal does not work and you installed Python via the
Anaconda distribution, go to your anaconda main folder and remove the file `qt.conf`. No other real solution out
is there really.
