# âš¡ Short circuit


GridCal has unbalanced (sequence and rectangular) short circuit calculations.

## API

 Now let's run a line-ground short circuit in the third bus of
the South island of New Zealand grid example from reference book
Computer Analysis of Power Systems by J. Arrillaga and C.P. Arnold.

```python
import os
import GridCalEngine as gce

folder = os.path.join('..', 'Grids_and_profiles', 'grids')
fname = os.path.join(folder, 'South Island of New Zealand.gridcal')

grid = gce.open_file(filename=fname)

# Define fault index explicitly
fault_index = 2

# Run a Line-Ground short circuit on the bus at index 2
# Since we do not provide any power flow results, it will run one for us
results = gce.short_circuit(grid, fault_index, fault_type=gce.FaultType.LG)

print("Short circuit power: ", results.SCpower[fault_index])
```

A more elaborated way to run the simulation, controlling all the steps:

```python
import os
import GridCalEngine as gce

folder = os.path.join('..', 'Grids_and_profiles', 'grids')
fname = os.path.join(folder, 'South Island of New Zealand.gridcal')

grid = gce.open_file(filename=fname)

pf_options = gce.PowerFlowOptions()
pf = gce.PowerFlowDriver(grid, pf_options)
pf.run()

fault_index = 2
sc_options = gce.ShortCircuitOptions(bus_index=fault_index,
                                     fault_type=gce.FaultType.LG)

sc = gce.ShortCircuitDriver(grid, options=sc_options,
                            pf_options=pf_options,
                            pf_results=pf.results)
sc.run()

print("Short circuit power: ", sc.results.SCpower[fault_index])
```

Output:

```text
Short circuit power:  -217.00 MW - 680.35j MVAr
```

Sequence voltage, currents and powers are also available.

## Theory


### 3-Phase Short Circuit

First, declare an array of zeros of size equal to the number of nodes in the
circuit.

$$
    \textbf{I} = \{0, 0, 0, 0, ..., 0\}
$$

Then for single bus failure, compute the short circuit current at the selected bus $i$ and assign
that value in the $i^{th}$ position of the array $\textbf{I}$.

$$
    \textbf{I}_i = - \frac{\textbf{V}_{pre-failure, i}}{\textbf{Z}_{i, i} + z_f}
$$

Then, compute the voltage increment for all the circuit nodes as:

$$
    \Delta \textbf{V} = \textbf{Z} \times \textbf{I}
$$

Finally, define the voltage at all the nodes as:

$$
    \textbf{V}_{post-failure} = \textbf{V}_{pre-failure} + \Delta \textbf{V}
$$


- $\textbf{I}$: Array of fault currents at the system nodes.
- $\textbf{I}_B$: Subarray of $\textbf{I}$ such that all entries for non-selected buses are removed.
- $\textbf{V}_{pre-failure}$: Array of system voltages prior to the failure. This is obtained from the power flow study.
- $\textbf{V}_{pre-failure, B}$: Subarray of $\textbf{V}_{pre-failure}$ such that all entries for non-selected buses are removed.
- $z_f$: Impedance of the failure itself. This is a given value, although you can set it to zero if you don't know.
- $\textbf{z}_{f, B}$: Impedance of the failures of selected buses $B$.
- $\textbf{Z}$: system impedance matrix. Obtained as the inverse of the complete system admittance matrix.
- $\textbf{Z}_B$: submatrix of $\textbf{Z}$ such that all rows and columns for non-selected buses are removed.
