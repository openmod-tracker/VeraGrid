==========

Notice that some versions skip numbers. This is not an error,
this is because the stupid policy of pypi to not allow to correct packages.
Hence if something goes wrong, you need to re-upload with a new version number.


version 3.3.5
_____________

- Greatly improved PSS/e .raw file import support.

version 3.3.4
_____________

- The tower names are displayed correctly now.

- Completely switched from PyQt5 to PySide2.

- Added support for PSS/e RAW file format version 29.

- Overall bug fix.


version 3.3.0
_____________

- Now the branches and the buses have activation profiles. This allows to run time series
  where the topology changes. Only available for time series for the moment.

- The branches now allow to profile their temperature. This allows to change the resistance to explore heat effects.

- Added undo / redo to the profiles editor. This improves usability quite a bit.

- Added csv files into zip files as the GridCal default format. This allows to use the same logic
  as with the excel files but with much faster saving and loading times. Especially suited for
  large grids with large profiles.

- Added error logging for the power flow time series.

- Massive refactoring of the the files in the program structure, hoping to provide a more intuitive interface.

- Replace the internal profiles from Pandas DataFrames to numpy arrays.
  This makes the processing simpler and more robust.

- Added rating to cables.

- Changed the TransformerType inner property names to shorter ones.

- Plenty of bug fixes.
