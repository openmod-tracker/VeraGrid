Linear time-series optimization considering hydro plants
==========================================================

Just as power systems can be optimized accounting for all their electrical assets, the same can be said about the hydropower infrastructure. As a result, the operator ends up with two grids of different nature: one where electrons flow, and one where a fluid is transported. The two grids can be coupled, and consequently, they have to be simultaneously optimized. GridCal now integrates models for the fluid grid (e.g. a hydroelectric system), and adapts the optimization code to take these new devices into consideration.

The present document outlines the main additions in this regard, including:

- The models of a fluid grid.
- The effects of such new devices on the optimization problem.
- A practical example to illustrate the concepts.

1. Fluid models
---------------
There are five different models that have been introduced with this update. These are:

1. **Node**: a given point in the fluid network, which is supposed to have a certain fluid level, fluid devices connected to it (such as turbines, pumps or P2Xs) and branches (potentially both electrical and fluid paths).
2. **Path**: a connection between two fluid nodes, with limits in the flow it can transport. 
3. **Turbine**: a device that transforms the mechanical energy from the fluid to electrical energy. As such, it has a generator associated to it.
4. **Pump** a device that works in the reverse direction of a turbine. It converts electrical to mechanical energy.
5. **P2X** a device responsible for the appearance of fluid from the consumption of power. It symbolizes the generalization of the power-to-gas technology used in hydrogen production, for instance.

    An overview of a fluid network with nodes linked through paths, a P2X, a pump, and a turbine.

Each fluid model has a list of defining attributes. The relationship between the attribute name and the associated description is provided below.

It is worth noting that turbines, pumps and P2Xs are fluid devices coupled to an electrical machine. That is, a generator is automatically created when these devices are built. The following conditions have to be considered in the corresponding generators:
